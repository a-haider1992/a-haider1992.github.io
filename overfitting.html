        <h1>Overfitting in Deep Learning Models</h1>
        <p>Overfitting occurs when a deep learning model learns the training data too well, capturing noise and details that do not generalize to new data. This results in a model that performs well on the training data but poorly on unseen data.</p>
        
        <h2>Causes of Overfitting</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Complex models with too many parameters</li>
            <li>Insufficient training data</li>
            <li>Training for too many epochs</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Preventing Overfitting</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Use simpler models</li>
            <li>Gather more training data</li>
            <li>Use techniques like cross-validation</li>
            <li>Apply regularization methods (L1, L2)</li>
            <li>Use dropout layers in neural networks</li>
            <li>Early stopping during training</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Overfitting is a common challenge in deep learning, but with the right techniques, it can be mitigated. By understanding the causes and implementing strategies to prevent it, you can build models that generalize well to new data.</p>
